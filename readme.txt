R code I have written to analyse collected data, these are a work in progress.

HeadMovementDataAnalysis - Main R script for analysing head movment data. Takes in 567 peices of individual data (21 participants, 9 tasks, 3 readings per task ) and plots line, acceleration and velocity graphs.
SpikeRemoval - The collected data had some form of data spikes. This script removes them. This will be implemented into HeadMovementDataAnalysis when it is complete.
